        <h3>Batman V Superman</h3>
            <p>
             Batman V Superman is a terribly underrated movie, when it appeared a lot of people hated it,
             and even if the film is not perfect at all and could have been much worse, it has some really
             amazing elements that people use to ignore, as the fact that we can see a great character develpment
             of Bruce Wayne, who starts looking at Superman as a danger for humanity, blinded by the fear of seeing
             someone so powerful existing, and thinking about him as someone so different to an average human,
             trying to destroy him to keep humanity safe but not noticing that he's not an enemy, Bruce Wayne lives
             being wrong about Superman until the moment he mention his mother, when he can notice that after all
             he's just a normal person, with feelings, with important people who loves and wants to protect, finding
             out that he's just a normal person inside, and finally seeing him as a hero that would give it all to
             protect this planet. Then Bruce Wayne finally noticed that he was wrong all the time and start his change.
             As we can see Superman being the symbol of goodness and sacrifice he always was.

        <h3>Spiderman 3</h3>
             <p>
             This is another uderrated film, thankfully not so destroyed by critics as Batman V Superman, but surprisingly
             really bad received by critics when it was just released, becoming in the last years a classic. Many people disliked the "Emo" Peter Parker,
             he was hated, and even gave birth to the meme of "Bully Maguire", but in reality, this Peter Parker is so realistic, due to his age and personality.
             Peter was always a shy boy, who's mistreated by many people, and had a terrible luck, at school, at work, at love and can't even pay his apartment.
             He's used to be always the one who people treats bad or just looks down at, so when Venom takes possesion of him, maximizing his aggressive characteristics
             he becomes a badass, or well... What a nerdy kid like him thinks is being badass, having so funny moments in which ones, somehow, he let himself go and
             do what he want for the first time in his life.

        <h3>Man of Steel</h3>
             <p>
             Man of Steel is the ultimate Superman film. It shows you the life of a kid that came from another world and how hard he struggled to be
              a normal person, suffering a lot for being different and valuing how much support he received by his adoptive parents. We see someone so thankful,
             that learnt to value love and what these adoptive parents taught to him, as always do what's right. Looking at him always trying to do that,
             and having to take difficult decisions when he notices that sometimes in life you can't do the best.
             </p>
        <h3>Batman begins</h3>
             <p>
              Batman Begins gives us the picture of what Christopher Nolan thought about how would be a superhero like Batman in real life. Shows us his motivations.
             His mistakes, his evolution, his training, how it's all a so hard process in every single aspect of his life, even in the emotional one. Someone who
             was about to become a murderer to take his revenge, but could open his eyes at time. It also shows
             us what makes Batman so different, the fact that he's not a nice gentleman as Superman or your good neighboor, Spiderman, the fact that he's not nice
             at all, he's scary, a risk for criminals, the justice in its more raw state, but keeping a so fair sense of it, not wanting to cross limits as the ones
             who taught to him to not become a criminal. And its so fast and necessary reflexion about that taking the best decision is not about doing things wrong,
             but sometimes requieres you to not being the hero. 
             </p>
        <h3>The Batman</h3>
             <p>
             This film shows us the most disenchanted version of this super hero, the traumatized rich kid that grew up all alone, ignorant of the truth, and full
             of pain and restrain. The one that is not a super hero but a selfish person trying to feel better taking revenge against criminals for what criminal world
             took from him. The self destructive person that doesn't matter how much wounds are over his body, won't stop getting out to fight crime because is obsessed
             but don't notice that he became a fear symbol. Passing through a breakdown that opens his eyes, to notice that he's not doing things right. Decidig then to
             stop being a symbol of revenge, to become a symbol of hope.
