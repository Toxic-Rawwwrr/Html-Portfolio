<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My Name is Arturo Quintanilla, and I'm an amazing web developer. Much better than you think.</p>

<p>I'm from Arequipa, Peru. My education began in a strict Catholic school, which initially made studying a challenge. However, I discovered a passion for subjects like history, communication, and psychology.
  Despite struggling with math initially, a private tutor changed my perspective, and I found joy in problem-solving. I also developed strong logical skills through chess.
  In university, I studied Communication and Journalism, discovering my love for research. Later, I pursued Optics and Optometry, mastering math concepts.
  I also worked as a Real Estate Manager, earning a Digital Marketing certification. Lately, I've delved into Web Development and Design, making significant progress in this field.
</p>

<p>I love understanding how everything works, so I'm really good creating well done pages, making them funcional, efficient, and pretty. So if you're looking for someone who can
  carry your project, then that person is definitely me.
